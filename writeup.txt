Task 1:

    Fully implemented.

Task 2:

    I floored the coordinates of the endpoints to enable all-integer version of the Bresenham algorithm. I also use sample points that are full points instead of half points. With this method, there might be some errors but will not affect the overall image.
    The float-point version with half-point sample points is also in my codebase but commented out. I found the first version to have less different pixels (w.r.t. the reference) than the second version, so I adopt the first version.

Task 3:

    Fully implemented.

Task 4:

    Fully implemented.
